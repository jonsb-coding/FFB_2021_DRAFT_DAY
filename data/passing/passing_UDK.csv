"Kyler Murray","ARI","12","1","417.5","3.3","4.06","1","Kyler was hyped by many in the fantasy community to take the next step as a dual-threat fantasy monster and he delivered. Before Josh Allen wrestled away the title at the end, Murray held the QB1 spot from Weeks 1 to 16. He formed a dynamite combo with DeAndre Hopkins bucking the negative trend of WRs changing teams in the offseason. He’s now the only QB in league history to throw for 3,500 passing yards and run for 800+ yards in the same season. His floor is high and if Kliff Kingsbury figures out how to be a bit more creative and push the ball downfield, Murray has a chance to reclaim the QB1 throne in 2021.","Unlock with the 2021 UDK+.

"Patrick Mahomes","KC","12","2","403.1","1.3","2.05","1","It felt like Mahomes almost fell under the radar this year in fantasy but he was still off the charts. He tied Aaron Rodgers for lowest INT rate (1.0 %) and led the league with 316 passing yards per game. Since 2018, Mahomes has been a top-12 fantasy QB in 34 out of 45 starts, an insane 75 percent! His Super Bowl defeat might stain the minds of many but for fantasy, he’s still a clear QB1. 40+ passing TDs seems almost like a safe line at this point.","Unlock with the 2021 UDK+. Get the UDK+."
"Lamar Jackson","BAL","8","3","382.1","2.7","4.08","2","His TD rate was bound to drop but it felt like the passing pie in Baltimore was a baby-sized portion some weeks as he had 12(!) games under 200 passing yards and only three games of 3+ passing TDs. On the ground, Lamar averaged only 13 fewer yards per game, had the same amount of rushing TDs (7), and less than half a yard per carry difference from his historic 2019 MVP season. He’s still a game-breaker as he now owns two of the top-3 QB rushing seasons of all-time. He’s an high-risk, high-reward player as you need him to boom in order to return his 5th round draft cost.","Unlock with the 2021 UDK+. Get the UDK+."
"Josh Allen","BUF","7","4","380.8","1.7","3.12","2","Allen’s transformation to one of the league’s most accurate passers in 2020 was nothing short of spectacular. The MVP runner-up was a fantasy force finishing as the QB1 on the back of 37 passing TDs and another eight on the ground, as essentially Buffalo’s goal-line back. He’s a top-5 QB paired up with an elite wideout (Stefon Diggs) in a passing game that led the league in pass rate and 3WR sets. There’s a scenario where he gets even better…","Unlock with the 2021 UDK+. Get the UDK+."
"Dak Prescott","DAL","7","5","351.4","3.3","5.07","3","Through the first month of the season, Dak was on pace for 6,728 passing yards! His injury was devastating and completely sunk the rest of the Cowboys’ season. He got the bag this offseason and is set up as Dallas’ franchise guy after years of speculation. Dak is a legitimate MVP candidate and with a healthy offensive line, it’s not hard seeing him settle back in as a top-5 fantasy QB in 2021.","Unlock with the 2021 UDK+. Get the UDK+."
"Aaron Rodgers","GB","13","6","351.1","4.7","7.08","3","Hope you enjoyed your Green Bay Packers offseason circus. Rodgers proved all of his naysayers wrong as he went out and put up an MVP season at the age of 37. On top of 48 passing TDs, he was especially lethal inside the red-zone leading the league with a 73 percent completion rate and 35 passing TDs. If Davante Adams is his partner in crime in 2021, Rodgers is a threat for 40+ TDs again. If he remains a Packer, he's an easy top-10 QB although maybe we still have more drama left to unfold...","Unlock with the 2021 UDK+. Get the UDK+."
"Tom Brady","TB","9","7","350.4","3.0","8.06","3","It’s almost unfair at this point that the Plant Man continues to steamroll to another Super Bowl. It took him a second to adjust but Bruce Arians’ relentless desire to push the ball downfield paid off: Brady led the league in Air Yards and 20+ yard completions. His 6.6 percent TD rate was his highest in more than a decade as he was equipped with better weapons than much of his time in New England. He’ll look to run it back in the NFC South where the Buccaneers might assert themselves as alpha if New Orleans takes a step back. As a fantasy QB, Brady belongs in the conversation as a top-10 QB although his stats suggested he feasted on bottom-tier defenses in 2020.","Unlock with the 2021 UDK+. Get the UDK+."
"Russell Wilson","SEA","9","8","348.1","3.7","5.05","4","For the second year in a row, it was a tale of two seasons as Week 10 was a cliff for Wilson fantasy managers. He was the QB2 in points per game from Weeks 1-9 but QB16 from Week 10 on. One of the keys to Wilson’s early success was play-action. He had the highest completion percentage (74.3) on those plays in the league. But teams figured out DK Metcalf and Tyler Lockett’s deep ball game and after being ousted in the playoffs, there has been some off-season chatter about Wilson wanting to move on from Seattle. He’s a QB1 no matter what but how your fantasy team traverses the ups-and-downs of Mr. Unlimited is a bit frustrating.","Unlock with the 2021 UDK+. Get the UDK+."
"Jalen Hurts","PHI","14","9","346.8","6.3","8.08","4","With Carson Wentz shipped out of town, Hurts looks like the main guy in Philadelphia. In four starts during Weeks 14-17, Hurts was a better fantasy star than real-life QB. He averaged 68 rushing yards per game, the most ever for a rookie QB with at least four starts. On the other hand, he had the lowest adjusted completion percentage in the league during that span. His upside is immense because of how electric he is on the ground. He’ll be a popular QB who fits the mold of a Year 2 breakout in the league but he’s not really a secret as his hype is driving him up the draft boards this summer.","Unlock with the 2021 UDK+.

"Taysom Hill","NO","6","10","340.7","7.2","19.11","4","The Saints could certainly take a step back this year with Drew Brees gone. Teams now have more film to prepare for Hill's style of play so don't expect the same league-leading adjusted completion percentage in 2021. His production on the ground alone makes him a late-round QB worth “shooting your shot” with his early-season schedule. The Saints have said that Taysom Hill and Jameis Winston will compete for the starting role. *If you think Jameis Winston will be the starter, he will likely be drafted as a top 15 fantasy QB.","Unlock with the 2021 UDK+.

"Justin Herbert","LAC","7","11","336.5","3.3","6.01","4","We just witnessed the greatest rookie QB passing season of all-time as Herbert was unbelievable from the get-go. His 31 passing TDs gets the press but he also set the rookie record for completion percentage (66.5) for any QB with 500+ pass attempts. Herbert led all QBs with completions under pressure and 3rd down passing TDs. With a healthy Keenan Allen and Austin Ekeler, Herbert looks to have a high-floor but will be in the conversation of top-8 QBs selected come draft time.","Unlock with the 2021 UDK+. Get the UDK+."
"Ryan Tannehill","TEN","13","12","332.7","4.0","9.09","4","After receiving a massive contract extension in the offseason as the Titans’ franchise QB, Tannehill responded with an AFC South title. He was clutch, leading the NFL in 4th quarter comebacks (5) and game-winning drives (6). As a fantasy QB, Tannehill was almost 10 fantasy points per game better at home and his final season ranking of QB7 was bolstered by five rushing TDs in his final three games. He’s a solid low-end QB1 who relies more on efficiency than volume. Now having Julio Jones paired with A.J. Brown, Tannehill's chances to repeat as a top 10 fantasy QB have gone way up.","Unlock with the 2021 UDK+. Get the UDK+."
"Carson Wentz","IND","14","13","307.1","5.3","14.03","5","For all of the turmoil Wentz faced this season, he was the QB7 for the first seven weeks of the season and a viable every week start. But you know the rest of the story, as he crashed and burned into losing his job to Jalen Hurts before being traded to Indianapolis, and reunited with Frank Reich. The QB Guru will have to correct some of Wentz’s mistake-prone ways as he holds onto the ball for way too long, hence the reason he led the NFL in sacks despite not playing the final month of the season. The change of scenery should do wonders but he’s a bit of a mystery for 2021. Take your late-round shot if you think he still has some juice but also be willing to cut bait if he’s carried over some bad habits.","Unlock with the 2021 UDK+. Get the UDK+."
"Kirk Cousins","MIN","7","14","301.4","3.3","12.05","5","You might’ve deleted Cousins from your 2020 memory but Captain Kirk set career-highs in passing TDs (35) and TD rate (6.9) but was only  QB11 on the season. It felt like a fantasy season out of place as that passing TD total would’ve ranked second in the NFL in 2019. In fact, Cousins’ fantasy finish is the lowest ever for a QB with 35+ passing TDs. Nevertheless, he is hitched to two top-notch WRs that should continue to buoy his fantasy value as a streamer. Cousins is a sneaky late round QB everyone will probably overlook again in 2021.","Unlock with the 2021 UDK+. Get the UDK+."
"Matt Ryan","ATL","6","15","300.5","3.7","11.09","5","We know what Ryan is at this point: a yardage monster who is a gamble in the TD department. He led the league in completions for the second year in a row but also in “interceptable” passes with 38, although his end of season line looks more acceptable with just 11 INTs.  He also paced the league in pass attempts with 626 but managed only 26 passing TDs, which has been his bugaboo in his career. The early offseason sentiment is that the Falcons were ready to move on but their moves recently have dictated they're ready to roll with him for at least another two years. He can easily finish inside the top-8 with new head coach Arthur Smith but you won’t have to draft him there. Expect more play-action passes and perhaps we'll see a flood of TDs. While Calvin Ridley has reached star status, Matt Ryan has struggled in the past without Julio on the field.","Unlock with the 2021 UDK+. Get the UDK+."
"Matthew Stafford","LAR","11","16","298.1","3.3","9.05","5","Matty snapback has long been a Footballers favorite and he moved on after 12 years in Detroit to Sean McVayville in Los Angeles. Stafford’s strengths of pinpoint accuracy and downfield passing should bolster a passing attack that totaled a paltry 20 passing TDs in 2020. Stafford had five games of three or more passing TDs last year, as many as Kyler Murray, but he can also disappear at times. With Cam Akers likely taking a step forward and a plentiful array of WRs, Stafford and the Rams are set up for success. But for fantasy, Stafford might not touch the same passing volume he had in Detroit.","Unlock with the 2021 UDK+. Get the UDK+."
"Trevor Lawrence","JAX","7","17","296.7","5.3","8.01","5","We all knew this was coming. Jacksonville’s franchise gets to press reset on their recent draft failings and now envision what could be moving forward. The AFC South division is by far the worst in the league and while the Jaguars defense needs major work, the offense could make some noise in 2021. This might be the best offensive pairing ever for a #1 overall QB. He has three legitimate WRs and three RBs each able to contribute. Lawrence’s generational chorus has been sung again and again but where he excelled in 2020 at Clemson was short-area and deep passing. In 2020, he led college football in “screen yards” for a reason while also accumulating a 113.4 passer rating and ten TDs on 20+ yard pass attempts. He’s worth a late round stab at catching some rookie magic. It shouldn’t surprise anyone if Lawrence finishes year one inside the top-15.","Unlock with the 2021 UDK+. Get the UDK+."
"Joe Burrow","CIN","10","18","289.8","6.5","8.07","6","Burrow’s rookie year was promising in many ways before going down with a serious leg injury. He made his fantasy dough on volume averaging the most pass attempts per game (40.4) by a rookie in NFL history. However, he also played a little reckless taking 32 sacks (tie-2nd most) & 42 QB hits (tied-5th most) over the first 11 weeks of the season. He also sported the 3rd lowest adjusted completion rate on deep passes in the NFL. Ask A.J. Green. His recovery timeline makes a Week 1 start iffy. Until we get a clear timeline, he likely will be a QB to pick up off the waiver wire early.","Unlock with the 2021 UDK+. Get the UDK+."
"Ryan Fitzpatrick","WAS","9","19","285.8","6.0","14.05","6","Let’s ride! Fitzpatrick is not merely an NFL legend but a Fantasy Footballers favorite as one of the most unique individuals to grace the field. He historically peppers his WRs with targets and as recent as 2019 was a league winner for fantasy. Excitement aside, he does crash-and-burn quite often for fantasy so be willing to cut bait if things don’t work out as well as we want to.","Unlock with the 2021 UDK+. Get the UDK+."
"Baker Mayfield","CLE","13","20","282.4","3.0","11.11","6","The Browns took a major step forward in 2020 but for most of the year, he didn’t help you out for fantasy. From Weeks 1-11, he was the QB31 in fantasy points per game, the same as Drew Lock. Woof. However, from Weeks 12-15, he was the QB3 eventually beating the Steelers in the WildCard round of the playoffs. The Browns should be a top tier AFC team once again but Baker is best left on the waiver wire for much of the year as the ground-and-pound approach with the Cleveland running game is preferred by HC Kevin Stefanski.","Unlock with the 2021 UDK+.

"Derek Carr","LV","8","21","280.9","5.0","18.01","6","Through the first six games, his TD:INT ratio was 13:2 with a 72% completion rate. The Raiders were actually in the playoff hunt for much of the year after starting 6-3 including a win in Arrowhead against the Chiefs. Carr set career highs in passing yards, yards per completion & QB Rating and yet you wouldn’t know it based on Jon Gruden’s resting angry face. He’s a fine real life NFL QB who typically is streamable in plus matchups throughout the year. We don’t advise drafting him in redraft with few proven weapons outside of Darren Waller.","Unlock with the 2021 UDK+. Get the UDK+."
"Daniel Jones","NYG","10","22","279.8","7.0","15.02","7","Time to swing for the fences. We're in Year 3 of the Daniel Jones experiment and this is the best set of weapons he's had. We saw glimpses of him as an impact fantasy QB his rookie year and last year was a disaster with Saquon hurt and the offensive line in shambles. Remember that fantasy is different than reality and the Giants were actually knocking on the door of the playoffs last year. Worst case scenario is he develops a case of fumbilitis and you can him cut early. On the other end of the spectrum, he could piece together a top-7 season and you can gloat that you hopped on Daniel Jones' back to a #FootClanTitle.","Unlock with the 2021 UDK+. Get the UDK+."
"Ben Roethlisberger","PIT","7","23","277.3","6.3","18.02","7","The Steelers season was a mirage as early success eventually nosedived into a first round exit in the playoffs. Big Ben was pressured on the lowest percentage of his dropbacks in the NFL, but had a league-leading 459 dropbacks of less than 2.5 seconds, which masked an inefficient offensive line. 
  The 17-year veteran is going to give it one last go-around in 2021 but the line still looks like a problem. He can put up monster games so be ready to use him in plus home matchups.","Unlock with the 2021 UDK+. Get the UDK+."
"Tua Tagovailoa","MIA","14","24","264.6","6.0","14.10","8","The Dolphins went 6-3 in Tua’s starts but you’d think he went 3-6 with the way fantasy managers wanted Ryan Fitzpatrick back at the helm. Some of his upside was on display against Kansas City in Week 14 as he threw for 316 yards, two passing TDs, and added another score on the ground en route to being the QB4 on the week. But most of his targets throughout the season were of the low aDOT variety. Since 2000, his 9.75 yards per completion ranks 49th of 51 rookie QBs 8+ starts in a given season. The excuses need to subside though as Devante Parker, Will Fuller V, and now Jaylen Waddle give him three legitimate weapons. He could surprise or submarine the entire offense’s upside.","Unlock with the 2021 UDK+. Get the UDK+."

Now in Carolina, he has the weapons in place at WR (Moore, Anderson, Marshall) and fantasy’s most valuable player (CMC). The Adam Gase excuses used like crop dusting farts should no longer linger. His metrics across the board are porous through three years especially how he responds under pressure. If there is room for optimism, OC Joe Brady is creative enough to make this work.

"Zach Wilson","NYJ","6","26","259.4","4.0","15.10","8","The baby-faced BYU signal-caller made his mark on an “out-of-nowhere” junior season where he put up 41 combined touchdowns albeit against weak competition. Wilson won over scouts and Jets management with his “off-platform” throws and improvisation skills that many likened to Aaron Rodgers or dare we say Patrick Mahomes. While those are a bit grandiose, Wilson does have the mobility to make things happen on the ground and the Jets seem to be surrounding him with the type of weapons and offensive line protection that Sam Darnold never had. It looks like Wilson will start Day 1. For redraft, he’s not draftable yet until we see him on an NFL field.","Unlock with the 2021 UDK+. Get the UDK+."
"Jared Goff","DET","9","27","257.3","4.0","20.02","8","You kind of feel sorry for Goff, the native California boy who was shipped out of town to Detroit aka football Siberia. Unfortunately, the Rams saw the writing on the wall for a QB who turned into more of a hindrance than a difference-maker on the football field. Goff turned in the lowest yards per attempt of his career and boosted his stats against bottom-16 defenses averaging 11.26 more fantasy points against them, the highest discrepancy among all QBs. He’s still young but this Lions team is devoid of any pass-catching talent and looks destined to be a bottom feeder in 2021. He’s off the redraft radar but could have some streamable moments at home in the right matchup.","Unlock with the 2021 UDK+. Get the UDK+."
"Teddy Bridgewater","DEN","11","28","247.3","6.5","23.01","8","He might have a chance to start in Denver but Teddy B did not take advantage of his shot at commanding an NFL offense in Carolina.

"Justin Fields","CHI","10","29","246.5","7.7","11.04","8","The tumble to pick 11 was unforeseen by many draft pundits but the ammo that Chicago unloaded to move up nine spots shows you just how desperate this team was to jump on Fields. He’s an effortless thrower and a dynamic runner who has shown out well in big spots on the national stage. While Andy Dalton apparently is the team’s QB1, we’ve seen this same refrain when Mike Glennon (yes, the great MG) was named starter only for #2 overall pick Mitchell Trubisky to quickly supplant him. Fields is way more talented and should resurrect the marketability of this Bears franchise and give Allen Robinson II some optimism about who is throwing him the ball.

Last year, he was basically a RB scoring 12 rushing TDs but averaging a meager 177 passing yards including six games with fewer than 120. The passing offense was historically bad and the Patriots drafted Mac Jones at 15th overall. Newton is likely a veteran bridge and it’s hard to consider him the year long starter especially at his salary of only $3.5 million guaranteed.

After BOB’s departure following an 0-4 start, Watson was the QB1 the rest of the way averaging 25 fantasy points per contest. He led the NFL in passing yards and yards per pass attempt despite losing DeAndre Hopkins.
